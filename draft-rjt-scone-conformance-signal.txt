                    CAP Conformance Signal For SCONE
               draft-rjt-scone-conformance-signal-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes conformance signals to be sent by CAPs when
   they are able to adapt to bitrate indicated by the SCONE signal so
   that CSPs stop policing.

1.  Introduction

   The primary objective of SCONE is to facilitate communication between
   CSPs and CAPs regarding throughput advice.  One of the main
   motivations is the recognition that traffic shapers are expensive and
   inaccurate, and they should be disabled if possible.  A paper
   (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/
   en//pubs/archive/45411.pdf) was pubished on the prevalance and
   harmfulness of packet policers specifically.  However, the ability
   for CSPs to unidirectionally send signals to the client does not
   provide CSPs with assurance to disable them.

   In addition to determining the format and delivery method for
   throughput advice, the working group should also establish the
   conditions under which CSPs SHOULD deactivate their traffic shapers
   and transition into trust-and-verify mode.  This helps CSPs by
   reducing the costs of traffic shapers and CAPs by reducing the
   workload of congestion controllers.

2.  Proposals

   The following proposals assume the throughput advice is transmitted
   from CSPs to CAPs in the format of a QUIC packet.

   1.  The CSP default marks the 4-tuple flow as conformant when its
       SCONE packet is received by the QUIC client.  The CSP SHOULD not
       disable traffic shapers until it confirms the QUIC client has
       acked the SCONE signal.  Because the CSP lacks visibility into
       packets containing ACK frames, it MAY only deduce the QUIC
       client's receipt of the signal by observing the cessation of
       SCONE packet retransmissions by the QUIC server.  If the CSP
       gives an unrealistically low throughput advice and the QUIC
       client decides to not follow, the client SHOULD not ack the SCONE
       packet.  The SCONE protocol SHOULD also specify a limit on the
       number of SCONE packet retransmissions.  On retransmission
       timeout, the QUIC server MUST not retransmit more SCONE packets,
       and the CSP SHOULD consider the current flow ineligible for
       SCONE.

   2.  The QUIC client signals conformance by echoing back the SCONE
       packet.  Upon accepting the throughput advice, the QUIC client
       MAY send back the SCONE packet along with its ack packet to the
       QUIC server.  Upon receiving the SCONE packet, the CSP SHOULD
       drop it and disable traffic shapers.  The QUIC client MAY refuse
       the throughput advice by not sending the SCONE packet back.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   The transmission of the conformance signal MUST employ the same
   security protection mechanism utilized for the original SCONE
   packets.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
