                    CAP Conformance Signal For SCONE
               draft-rjt-scone-conformance-signal-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes conformance signals to be sent by CAPs when
   they are able to adapt to bitrate indicated by the SCONE signal so
   that CSPs stop policing.

1.  Introduction

   The primary objective of SCONE is to facilitate communication between
   CSPs and CAPs regarding throughput advice.  One of the main
   motivations is the recognition that traffic shapers are expensive and
   inaccurate, and they should be disabled if possible.  A paper
   (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/
   en//pubs/archive/45411.pdf) was pubished on the prevalance and
   harmfulness of packet policers specifically.  However, the ability
   for CSPs to unidirectionally send signals to the client does not
   provide CSPs with assurance to disable them.

   In addition to determining the format and delivery method for
   throughput advice, the working group should also establish the
   conditions under which CSPs SHOULD deactivate their traffic shapers
   and transition into trust-and-verify mode.  This helps CSPs by
   reducing the costs of traffic shapers and CAPs by reducing the
   workload of congestion controllers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   The transmission of the conformance signal MUST employ the same
   security protection mechanism utilized for the original SCONE
   packets.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
